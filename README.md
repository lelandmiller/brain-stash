# Brain Stash

A modern solution for information management.

## Overview

Brain Stash is a project I started because I was unsatisfied with other
information management systems available to me.

Brain Stash aims to make your notes useful to you in any way that it can, while
still storing all data in plain-text (barring images or attachments to notes).
It uses markdown with some minor extensions, but aims to produce markdown that
is compatible with other tools where ever possible.
